=================

This is a Python (v2.7) script for securely storing and managing passwords. 
It stores the passwords in a file and encrypts it with AES encryption with your specified key, and makes the passwords available whenever asked for.

=================

Dependency: It uses the PyCrypto module developed by Dwayne C. Litzenberger. Install that module before running the script.

This is the basic version with some bugs. It needs some modification for the file creation part.
